What this is
============

Visualization of time. Homework for http://www.iaacblog.com/mai2012-2013-programming/.

This is the iPhone app version. I first sketched this project in Processing, see: https://github.com/bertbalcaen/MClockProcessingSketch

How to build the app
====================

Requirements:

* the iOS release of openFrameworks v0072: of_v0072_ios_release, see http://www.openframeworks.cc/versions/v0072/of_v0072_ios_release.zip
* ofxUI, see https://github.com/rezaali/ofxUI. Follow instructions there.
* ofxXmlSettings: included in of_v0072_ios_release, but must be added to addons in Xcode.
